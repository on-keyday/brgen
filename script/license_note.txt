This bundle contains license information for web, LSP, and Golang dependencies. 
Some are exclusively used in development or build processes (such as compilers), 
while others are integrated into the binary. 
However, counting and categorizing all dependencies based on their usage has proven challenging for me.
The licenses for these libraries have been gathered using tools 
like licensed (https://github.com/github/licensed) and gocredits (https://github.com/Songmu/gocredits), 
and the author has personally verified them. 
It's important to note that the author is not a lawyer, 
so there might be gaps in the consideration of licenses. 
If any issues with the licenses are identified, 
please report them through GitHub Issues at https://github.com/on-keyday/brgen.
