These bundle contains license information of web, lsp, and golang dependency.
Some of them are used in only development or build (like compiler) and some of them are contained in binary.
But it is too difficult for me to count and separate all dependency by usage.
So all of licenses that related to this work(https://github.com/on-keyday/brgen) 
collected by licensed (https://github.com/github/licensed) and gocredits (https://github.com/Songmu/gocredits)
and reviewed by author.
But author is a non lawyer, so maybe not complete considered about the licenses. 
So if licenses have problems, report it by GitHub Issue of https://github.com/on-keyday/brgen
